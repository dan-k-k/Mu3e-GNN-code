# Graph Neural Networks for Track Finding in Mu3e

This repository contains the full process of developing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for the Mu3e experiment.

The Mu3e experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) searches for the charged-lepton-flavour-violating decay 𝜇+ → 𝑒+𝑒+𝑒− with the goal of excluding branching fractions above 10−16 at the 90% confidence level [1]. This decay is essentially forbidden by the Standard Model (SM) and any observation would provide evidence of new physics [2].›
